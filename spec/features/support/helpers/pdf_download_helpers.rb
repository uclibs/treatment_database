# pdf_download_helpers.rb includes helper methods specific to testing
# PDF download functionalities within the application. Currently, this
# file provides utilities to trigger and verify the download of PDFs,
# such as ensuring that a PDF download initiates when a user clicks a
# download button. This functionality is critical for validating that
# our document generation systems work as expected across various user
# interactions. While the scope of this helper is presently focused on
# download checks, it is designed to be extensible. Future enhancements
# may include additional checks for the content and formatting of
# downloaded PDFs, which would further solidify the reliability of our
# document handling features.

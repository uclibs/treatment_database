# read_only_user_spec.rb tests the application from the perspective
# of users with read-only access. It verifies that these users can view
# documents and data as expected but are restricted from creating,
# editing, or deleting any records. This spec ensures that the application
# enforces these permissions correctly, crucial for maintaining data
# integrity and security. By confirming that read-only users cannot
# perform unauthorized actions, this spec helps safeguard the application
# against potential data manipulation or accidental changes by users without
# adequate privileges.

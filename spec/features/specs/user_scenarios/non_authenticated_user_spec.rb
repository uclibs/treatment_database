# non_authenticated_user_spec.rb focuses on the behavior of the
# application when accessed by users who are not logged in. The primary
# purpose of this spec is to ensure that non-authenticated users are
# correctly redirected to the login screen and that they do not have
# access to any application functionalities beyond this point. This
# file plays a crucial role in securing the application by verifying
# that proper access controls are in place, preventing unauthorized
# access to sensitive data and features. Tests within this file
# confirm the robustness of the application's authentication gates.
